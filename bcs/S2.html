        <p>The <strong>second season</strong> of the American television series <em>Better Call Saul</em> premiered on
            <strong>February 15, 2016</strong>, and concluded on <strong>April 18, 2016</strong>. The
            <strong>ten-episode season</strong> was broadcast on <strong>Monday nights</strong> in the United States on
            <strong>AMC</strong>. A <strong>spin-off-prequel</strong> of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>Better Call
                Saul</em> was created by <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong> and <strong>Peter Gould</strong>, both of whom
            also worked on <em>Breaking Bad</em>.</p>

        <p>This season, like the previous, mainly takes place in <strong>2002</strong>, with <strong>Bob
                Odenkirk</strong> reprising his role as <strong>Jimmy McGill</strong>, a lawyer who has a feud with his
            brother <strong>Chuck</strong> (<strong>Michael McKean</strong>). Soon <strong>Kim Wexler</strong>
            (<strong>Rhea Seehorn</strong>), a Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (<strong>HHM</strong>) attorney who is Jimmy's
            lover and former mailroom co-worker, leaves the practice of law at <strong>HHM</strong> to start a solo
            practice in office space she shares with Jimmy. <strong>Jonathan Banks</strong> reprises his role as
            <strong>Mike Ehrmantraut</strong>; he is engaged in a conflict with the Mexican drug cartel after an
            altercation with <strong>Tuco</strong> (<strong>Raymond Cruz</strong>), which was orchestrated by
            <strong>Nacho Varga</strong> (<strong>Michael Mando</strong>). This results in Mike getting targeted by
            Tuco's uncle <strong>Hector</strong> (<strong>Mark Margolis</strong>).</p>

        <p>The <strong>second season</strong> of <em>Better Call Saul</em> received <strong>acclaim</strong> from
            critics, with praise for its <strong>acting performances</strong> and <strong>cinematography</strong>, and
            <strong>six nominations</strong> for the <strong>68th Primetime Emmy Awards</strong>, including
            <strong>Outstanding Drama Series</strong>.</p>
