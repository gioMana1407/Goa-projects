        <p>The <strong>fifth season</strong> of the AMC television series <em>Better Call Saul</em> premiered on
            <strong>February 23, 2020</strong>, in the United States, and concluded on <strong>April 20, 2020</strong>.
            The <strong>ten-episode season</strong> was broadcast on <strong>Mondays</strong> at <strong>9:00 pm
                (Eastern)</strong> in the United States, except for the premiere, which aired on a
            <strong>Sunday</strong>. <strong>Bob Odenkirk</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Banks</strong>, <strong>Rhea
                Seehorn</strong>, <strong>Patrick Fabian</strong>, <strong>Michael Mando</strong>, and <strong>Giancarlo
                Esposito</strong> reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by <strong>Tony
                Dalton</strong>, promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in the previous season. <em>Better
                Call Saul</em> is a <strong>spin-off prequel</strong> to <em>Breaking Bad</em> and was also created by
            <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong>; co-creator <strong>Peter Gould</strong> also worked on the series.</p>

        <p>The <strong>fifth season</strong> picks up where the fourth left off, also taking place in
            <strong>2004</strong>, four years before <strong>Jimmy McGill</strong> (<strong>Odenkirk</strong>) meets
            <strong>Walter White</strong> (<strong>Bryan Cranston</strong>) and <strong>Jesse Pinkman</strong>
            (<strong>Aaron Paul</strong>). The season shows the further evolution of Jimmy into the titular character,
            criminal defense lawyer <strong>"Saul Goodman"</strong>, after regaining his law license, while fully
            rejecting the goodwill that <strong>Howard Hamlin</strong> (<strong>Fabian</strong>) extends to him in the
            wake of his brother Chuck's death. <strong>Kim Wexler</strong> (<strong>Seehorn</strong>) is dismayed by
            Jimmy's secretive and sporadic nature as well as her own willingness to go along with Jimmy's morally
            ambiguous motives to move ahead in her casework. <strong>Lalo Salamanca</strong>'s (<strong>Dalton</strong>)
            presence in Albuquerque disrupts <strong>Gus Fring</strong>'s (<strong>Esposito</strong>) legitimate
            restaurant business and his reputation with the drug cartel. Both <strong>Nacho Varga</strong>
            (<strong>Mando</strong>), fearing for his father's safety, and <strong>Mike Ehrmantraut</strong>
            (<strong>Banks</strong>), who is struggling to cope with his killing of <strong>Werner Ziegler</strong>, are
            caught between Gus and Lalo's conflict, eventually drawing Jimmy and Kim in.</p>

        <p>The <strong>season</strong> was praised by critics, particularly for its <strong>performances</strong> and
            <strong>heightened tension</strong> compared to earlier seasons, and received <strong>four
                nominations</strong> at the <strong>72nd Primetime Emmy Awards</strong>, including for
            <strong>Outstanding Drama Series</strong>.</p>
