        <p>The <strong>sixth and final season</strong> of the AMC television series <em>Better Call Saul</em> premiered
            on <strong>April 18, 2022</strong>, in the United States, and concluded on <strong>August 15, 2022</strong>.
            The <strong>thirteen-episode season</strong> was broadcast on <strong>Mondays</strong> at <strong>9:00 pm
                (Eastern)</strong> in the United States on <strong>AMC</strong> and its streaming service
            <strong>AMC+</strong>. Each episode was released on <strong>Netflix</strong> the day after in certain
            international markets. The season was split into <strong>two parts</strong>; the first, consisting of the
            first seven episodes, concluded on <strong>May 23</strong>, before resuming with the second half, consisting
            of the final six episodes, on <strong>July 11</strong>. <strong>Bob Odenkirk</strong>, <strong>Jonathan
                Banks</strong>, <strong>Rhea Seehorn</strong>, <strong>Patrick Fabian</strong>, <strong>Michael
                Mando</strong>, <strong>Tony Dalton</strong>, and <strong>Giancarlo Esposito</strong> reprise their
            roles from previous seasons. <em>Better Call Saul</em> is a <strong>spin-off</strong>,
            <strong>prequel</strong>, and <strong>sequel</strong> of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, created by <strong>Vince
                Gilligan</strong> and <strong>Peter Gould</strong>.</p>

        <p>The first nine episodes mainly take place in <strong>Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong> in
            <strong>2004</strong>, four years before <strong>Jimmy McGill</strong> (<strong>Odenkirk</strong>) begins
            his association with meth cooks <strong>Walter White</strong> (<strong>Bryan Cranston</strong>) and
            <strong>Jesse Pinkman</strong> (<strong>Aaron Paul</strong>). The season shows the further evolution of
            Jimmy into the eponymous character, criminal defense lawyer <strong>"Saul Goodman"</strong>, as he and his
            wife <strong>Kim Wexler</strong> (<strong>Seehorn</strong>) execute their plan to force a resolution of the
            <strong>Sandpiper case</strong> by ruining the career of <strong>Howard Hamlin</strong>
            (<strong>Fabian</strong>). Simultaneously, it depicts <strong>Lalo Salamanca</strong>
            (<strong>Dalton</strong>) seeking revenge on <strong>Gus Fring</strong> (<strong>Esposito</strong>) for
            orchestrating an assassination attempt on him. The remaining episodes mainly take place in
            <strong>2010</strong>, after the events of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and show Saul living in <strong>Omaha,
                Nebraska</strong> under the alias <strong>"Gene Takavic"</strong>, hiding from the authorities after
            Walter's demise.</p>

        <p>The <strong>sixth season</strong> was filmed in <strong>Albuquerque</strong> over a period of <strong>eleven
                months</strong>. Many of its delays were due to the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> and
            <strong>Odenkirk's on-set heart attack</strong>. It was praised by critics, particularly for its
            <strong>performances</strong>, <strong>writing</strong>, <strong>visuals</strong>, <strong>emotional
                weight</strong>, and similarity to <em>Breaking Bad</em>. The first half received <strong>four
                nominations</strong> at the <strong>74th Primetime Emmy Awards</strong>, including <strong>Outstanding
                Drama Series</strong>. The second half received <strong>five nominations</strong> for the <strong>75th
                Primetime Emmy Awards</strong>, including <strong>Outstanding Drama Series</strong>, <strong>Odenkirk's
                sixth nomination</strong> for <strong>Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series</strong>, and
            <strong>Seehorn's second nomination</strong> for <strong>Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama
                Series</strong>.</p>
