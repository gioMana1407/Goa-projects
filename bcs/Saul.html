        <p class="saul"> <b>James Morgan "Jimmy" McGill,</b> better known by his business name <b>Saul Goodman,</b> is a
            fictional
            character created by <b>Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould</b> and portrayed by Bob Odenkirk in the television
            franchise <b>Breaking Bad.</b> He appears as a major character in <b>Breaking Bad (2009-2013)</b> and as the
            titular protagonist of its spin-off <b>Better Call Saul (2015-2022).</b>

            Saul is a self-centered and unscrupulous Albuquerque-based lawyer who embraces his tactics as a former con
            artist and becomes involved in the city's criminal underworld. In Breaking Bad, he acts as the consigliere
            for the methamphetamine cooks <b>Walter White and Jesse Pinkman</b> and plays a crucial role in the
            development of their drug empire. Better Call Saul's main storyline depicts Saul's origins as the aspiring
            lawyer <b>Jimmy McGill</b> and his moral deterioration in the six years before the events of <b>Breaking
                Bad;</b> it also features a post-Breaking Bad storyline, where Saul is living under the assumed name
            <b>Gene Takavic</b> , that explores the consequences of his actions in the franchise.

            Saul first appeared in <b> "Better Call Saul" (2009),</b> the eighth episode of Breaking Bad's second
            season. He was created to provide Walt and Jesse with a guide for their criminal activities and to replace
            <b>Hank Schrader</b> as <b>Breaking Bad's comic</b> relief. His name, "Saul Goodman", is a play on the
            phrase "it's all good, man". Although <b>Odenkirk</b> was initially cast for only four episodes as a guest
            actor, he became integral to the <b>Breaking Bad</b> narrative after <b>Gilligan and Gould</b> were
            impressed by his performance; <b>Odenkirk</b> subsequently joined the main cast in the third season and
            remained through to the fifth and final season of the show. Following <b>Breaking Bad's</b> conclusion,
            <b>Gilligan and Gould</b> began developing a Saul-focused spin-off depicting his origin story. The character
            also appeared in the animated short-form series Slippin' Jimmy, a spin-off of <b>Better Call Saul</b> which
            follows his childhood misadventures.

            Saul's characterization and <b>Odenkirk's</b> performance received critical acclaim. <b>Odenkirk</b> was
            nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series six times for his
            performance in <b>Better Call Saul.</b>[2]
