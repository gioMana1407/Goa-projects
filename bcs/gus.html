        <p><strong>Gustavo Fring</strong> is a fictional character portrayed by <strong>Giancarlo Esposito</strong> in
            the <em>Breaking Bad</em> franchise, serving as a major antagonist in the crime drama series <em>Breaking
                Bad</em> and a major character in its prequel <em>Better Call Saul</em>. He is a
            <strong>Chilean-American businessman</strong> and major narcotics distributor in the Southwestern United
            States who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food restaurants called
            <strong>Los Pollos Hermanos</strong> (The Chicken Brothers) and an industrial laundry facility called
            <strong>Lavander√≠a Brillante</strong> (Bright Laundry), as fronts used to launder money for a vast drug
            operation.
        </p>

        <p>Though outwardly he works with the Mexican cartel to distribute cocaine, he secretly plots revenge against
            its members over the death of his business associate and romantic partner <strong>Maximino "Max"
                Arciniega</strong> at the hands of his sworn archenemy <strong>Hector Salamanca</strong>, the patriarch
            of the cartel-backed drug trade in the Southwest. To become independent of the cartel's meth, he constructs
            a secret lab under his industrial laundry to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>

        <p>Fring was created as a character to replace that of <strong>Tuco Salamanca</strong> (played by departing
            actor <strong>Raymond Cruz</strong>) during the second season of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. Gus, as a stoic
            businessman, was created to be opposite to the chaotic Tuco and act as a foil to protagonist <strong>Walter
                White</strong>. The character has received high acclaim, with critics hailing Gus as one of the best
            villains in television; as such, <strong>Esposito's performance</strong> in the role has earned him several
            nominations and awards.</p>
