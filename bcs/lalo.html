        <p><strong>Eduardo "Lalo" Salamanca</strong>
            is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists in the AMC television series
            <em>Better Call Saul</em>, a spinoff of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. He is portrayed by <strong>Tony
                Dalton</strong>, with the character being created by Peter Gould and screenwriter Gordon Smith. Lalo is
            introduced in the show's fourth season but was originally mentioned in dialogue from the <em>Breaking
                Bad</em> episode "Better Call Saul" that introduces Saul Goodman, though Lalo does not appear in the
            series.
        </p>

        <p>Lalo is one of many nephews of <strong>Hector Salamanca</strong>, an enforcer of <strong>Don Eladio Vuente's
                drug cartel</strong>. After Hector becomes paralyzed due to a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help
            run the family drug operation in Albuquerque; he takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details of the
            operation than Hector did. Because of the rivalry between Hector and his sworn enemy <strong>Gus
                Fring</strong> themselves, Lalo becomes determined to disrupt both Gus' legitimate business and the
            latter's reputation with the cartel.</p>

        <p>Showrunners gave Dalton freedom to diverge from cartel stereotypes and portrayals of the other members of the
            Salamanca family. Series co-creator Vince Gilligan held himself responsible for delaying Lalo's
            introduction, which occurred because Gould wanted to introduce Lalo as early as season one. Unlike most
            other members of his family, Lalo is often charismatic and cheerful; like them, however, he can also be
            violent and murderous. Dalton's portrayal has been critically acclaimed, with some critics deeming Lalo to
            be one of the best villains on television.</p>
