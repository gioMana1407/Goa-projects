        <p><strong>Ignacio "Nacho" Varga</strong> is a fictional character who appears in the AMC
            television series <em>Better Call Saul</em>, a prequel spin-off of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. He is portrayed by
            <strong>Michael Mando</strong> and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould.

        <p>Dialogue that introduces <strong>Saul Goodman</strong> in the <em>Breaking Bad</em> episode "Better Call
            Saul" mentions Nacho and <strong>Lalo Salamanca</strong>, though neither appears in <em>Breaking Bad</em>.
            Nacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the <strong>Salamanca drug organization</strong>. He cares deeply
            for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, <strong>Manuel</strong>. He befriends <strong>Jimmy
                McGill</strong> after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his
            father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill <strong>Hector Salamanca</strong>, the
            family patriarch, by switching his medication. This is discovered by <strong>Gus Fring</strong>, who runs
            the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas' organization, which is
            further complicated when the shrewd <strong>Lalo</strong> arrives to oversee operations.</p>
